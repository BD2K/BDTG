The Center for Big Data in Translational Genomics is a multi-institution partnership coordinated by 
UC Santa Cruz to create scalable infrastructure for the broad application of genomics in biomedicine. 
This multinational collaboration between academia and industry will create data models and analysis tools 
to analyze massive data sets of genomic information. Such tools can be used to analyze genomes and gene 
expression data from thousands of individuals to uncover the contribution of gene variants to disease, 
with an initial focus on cancer. This knowledge will be instrumental in the development of precision 
diagnostic and treatment methods.
